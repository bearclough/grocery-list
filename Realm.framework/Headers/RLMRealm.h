 Obtains an instance of the default Realm.

 The default Realm is used by the `RLMObject` and `RLMArray` class methods
 which do not take a `RLMRealm` parameter, but is otherwise not special. The
 default Realm is persisted as default.realm under the Documents directory of
 your Application on iOS, and in your application's Application Support
 directory on OS X.

 `RLMRealm` objects are cached internally by Realm, and calling this method
 multiple times on a single thread within a single iteration of the run loop
 will normally return the same `RLMRealm` object. If you specifically want to
 ensure a `RLMRealm` object is destroyed (for example, if you wish to open a
 Realm, check some property, and then possibly delete the Realm file and
 re-open it), place the code which uses the Realm within an `@autoreleasepool
 {}` and ensure you have no other references to it.

 @warning `RLMRealm` instances are not thread safe and can not be shared across
 threads or dispatch queues. You must call this method on each thread you want
 to interact with the Realm on. For dispatch queues, this means that you must
 call it in each block which is dispatched, as a queue is not guaranteed to run
 on a consistent thread.

 @return The default `RLMRealm` instance for the current thread.

 in-memory Realm alive across cycles of the run loop, so without a strong

 Before beginning the write transaction, `beginWriteTransaction` updates the
 `RLMRealm` to the latest Realm version, as if refresh was called, and
 generates notifications if applicable. This has no effect if the `RLMRealm`
 was already up to date.

 It is rarely a good idea to have write transactions span multiple cycles of

 `RLMRealm` in the write transaction is kept alive until the write transaction

 update it to get the latest version.

 Even with this enabled, you can still call -refresh at any time to update the
 Realm before the automatic refresh would occur.

 Notifications are sent when a write transaction is committed whether or not
 this is enabled.

 Disabling this on an `RLMRealm` without any strong references to it will not
 have any effect, and it will switch back to YES the next time the `RLMRealm`
 object is created. This is normally irrelevant as it means that there is
 nothing to refresh (as persisted `RLMObject`s and `RLMArray`s have strong
 references to the containing `RLMRealm`), but it means that setting

 Performs a migration on the default Realm.

 Before you can open an existing `RLMRealm` which has a different on-disk schema
 from the schema defined in your object interfaces, you must supply a migration
 block which converts from the disk schema to your current object schema. At the
 minimum your migration block must initialize any properties which were added to
 existing objects without defaults and return a new schema version which is
 higher than the version of the on-disk schema.

 You should always call this method on startup if you have any migrations that
 may need to be run. Realm will not call your migration block if the schema of
 the file on disk matches your currently defined object schema. Calling this
 method after the `defaultRealm` has been created will throw an exception.

 @warning Unsuccessful migrations will throw exceptions. This will happen in the
 following cases:

 - The migration block was run and returns a schema version which is not higher
   than the previous schema version.
 - A new property without a default was added to an object and not initialized
   during the migration. You are required to either supply a default value or to
   manually populate added properties during a migration.

 Migrations which fail for other reasons (such as filesystem errors) will return
 a `NSError` object which describes the error.

 @param block       The block which migrates the Realm to the current version.
